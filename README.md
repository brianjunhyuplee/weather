## Prerequisites:
* Computer with internet access
## Objective: 

Create a website that searches a city and displays the weather conditions for current and next five days.


## Operation:

**To access the website, simply click on this [deploymentlink](https://brianjunhyuplee.github.io/weather/).**

1. The left side of the website has a spot to input.
2. Type a city and click the Go button.
3. The current weather is displayed on the right top of the website.
4. The weather for the next five is displayed under the current weather


## Process:
**1.  Create HTML**Â 

An HTML basic template was created with necessary basic formatting. Divs with no content were added to for later use when adding elements to the page

**2.  Weather API**

A weather API was used in order to retrieve information about weather conditions by city. 

*The below image shows the data stored after being parsed*
![Image of API](assets/images/json.png);

In order to use the API, a queryURL must be generated using an inputted query and an API key. The API key was obtained from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/)

*The query can be inputted using the line below*
```bash
    q = $("#userInputLine").val();
    var queryURL = "api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=" + q + "&" + apikey;
```


**3.  Local Storage**

Two main methods were implemented for the local storage.
1. setItem
     ```bash
    $("#btnId").on("click", function() {
    var str = JSON.stringify($("#textAreaId").val());
    localStorage.setItem('keyId',str);
  });
    ```
    - Every time the save button is clicked, the string inputted in the text area is saved.
    - JSON.stringify($("#textAreaId.val()")); turns the inputted value into a string.
    - that string is then put into the local storage under the keyId name.
2. getItem
    ```bash
    if(localStorage.getItem('keyId')!==null){
    $("#textAreaId").text(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('keyId')));
    }
    ```
    - Every time the page is refreshed, the string in the local storage under the keyId name will be outputted to the corresponding text area.
    - JSON.parse outputs the actual value into the text area.
        - If parse is not used, the output will have double quotations around the string.
